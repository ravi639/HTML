<li>How to center block elements using CSS1?</li>
<p><b>Ans:-</b><br>
	<b>Approach</b>: There are two steps to center a block-level element –<br>

<b>Step 1</b>: Define the external width – We need to define the external width. Block-level elements have the default width of 100% of the webpage, so for centering the block element, we need space around it. So for generating the space, we are giving it a width.<br>

<b>Step 2</b>: Set the left-margin and the right-margin of the element to auto – Since we produced a remaining space by providing external width so now we need to align that space properly that’s why we should use margin property. Margin is a property that tells how to align a remaining space. So for centering the element you must set left-margin to auto and right-margin to auto.<br>	</p>
